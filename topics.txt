I think these ideas are interesting. A good idea would be to first define the axis of bias â€” skin color, state of residence, language spoken, religion, caste, etc. more important in the Indian context. Check work of partha talukkdar https://aclanthology.org/2022.aacl-main.55.pdf You can expand on these. And then maybe you could have a first phase of writing biased templates and then subsequently sentences for each and possibly each language. Okay,gtg now. Will get in touch later.
